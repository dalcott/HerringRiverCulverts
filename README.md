# HerringRiverCulverts
All data used in analyses of manuscript: "Culverts delay upstream and downstream migrations of river herring (Alosa spp.)"
File descriptions:
"AllPITDetections_Herring_AllYears.csv" - this file contains all PIT telemetry detections of river herring throughout the course of the study. These records are used to derive most analyses performed in this study.
"AntennaCondensedPITRecords_Herring_CrossTalkCleaned.csv" - this file is a processed version of the PIT telemetry records where faulty detections due to crosstalk have been removed and multiple sequential detections at one location (i.e. antenna) are condensed to one record.
"CulvertPassageData_Light2.csv" - this file includes the data used to perform Cox regression of culvert passage times at all culvert sites.
"DelaySpeedData.csv" - this file includes groundspeeds of fish traveling through and between sites derived from the time between detections and the distance between locations.
"NonSHModelComp_Downstream_RequireSite.csv" - This table is the model fit comparison output of downstream culvert passage for the 4 mainstem river sites (i.e. excluding Schoolhouse) for all models tested.
"NonSHPassageModels_RequireSite.csv" - This file includes the list of candidate models tested for mainstem river sites (i.e. not Schoolhouse) for Cox regression of culvert passage rates.
"PassagePresences.csv" - this file identifies passage events at the tide gate.
"SHPassageModels_NoTurt_V2.csv" - this file contains a list of all candidate models tested for Cox regression of culvert passage rate at the Schoolhouse site, excluding snapping turtle presence in the culvert as a potential predictor.
"SHPassageModels_Turt_V2.csv" - this file contains a list of all candidate models tested for Cox regression of culvert passage rate at the Schoolhouse site, including snapping turtle presence in the culvert as a potential predictor.
"SHReturnModels_NoTurt_V2.csv" - this file contains a list of all candidate models tested for Cox regression of rate of return to the Schoolhouse site after failed passage, excluding snapping turtle presence in the culvert as a potential predictor.
"SHReturnModels_Turt_V2.csv" - this file contains a list of all candidate models tested for Cox regression of rate of return to the Schoolhouse site after failed passage, including snapping turtle presence in the culvert as a potential predictor.
"SiteMeasurements.xlsx" - this file includes dimensions of the culvert sites and distances between sites used in calculating groundspeeds and for comparing culvert characteristics.
"TimeToPassageData_SH.csv" - this file includes the data used for performing Cox regression of culvert passage at the Schoolhouse site.
